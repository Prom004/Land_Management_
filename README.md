PL_SQL_Assignment_Creating a simple database for land transactions:
In Kigali City, every piece of land must have it’s owner. The land itself is identified by its unique UPI address, owner’s SSN, location, and the purpose of the land. The Landowner has to have a unique ID and SSN, First Name, Last name, Address, age, and phone number. Each buyer or Tenant is also identified by a unique Tenant ID, SSN, Address, and Age. A buyer can obtain as many pieces of land as he needs where as the landowner only owns a maximum of one piece of land. If a commissioner is needed, the commissioner must have a commissioner’s ID, SSN, age, and phone number. A commissioner is allowed to commission as many houses as he can to as many potential buyers or Tenants. A landowner can contract with many commissioners and a commissioner can contract with many landowners. For each contract, you have to store a start date, end date, amount of the land and the contract number. The amount to which the land is bought must not be empty. A landowner is also required to notarize the documents as soon as he gives out the land with an official land officer who is identified by a unique officer ID, First name, last name, SSN, Government Department, and phone number.
